huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --local-dir Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --resume-download
```

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 3: Upgrade `pip`

Ensure `pip` is up to date:

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 5: Launch Jupyter Lab
